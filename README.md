# Energy Consumption Prediction

This project predicts energy consumption using machine learning techniques. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
I use it from kaggle.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `Energy_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Follow the step-by-step explanations and run the cells

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
The best-performing model was Linear-Regression with r2-score 0.799.
Model is y = 138.0289 * Square Footage + 50.9844 * Number of Occupants + 54.0334 * Appliances Used + 829.5917
